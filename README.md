A useful personal AI agent. Currently connects ChatGPT with iMessage.

Premise
The aim of this project is to make a user-friendly, easily accessible implementation of LLMs as a personal assistant/agent.

Roadmap
Next: add LangChain support for web search and Wolfram Alpha, and to enable future connections.
Future: improved database & memory (Pinecone?), access to personal information (connectors to calendar, documents, information 'silos' such as note-taking apps, readwise etc)
